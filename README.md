# Intelligent Engineering Partner - Flask Edition ðŸ¤–

This Flask application helps guide engineers through the nine classical phases of development, leveraging AI to streamline workflows and generate documentation.

## Overview

The application provides:
- A web interface to input and manage data for each of the 9 development phases.
- AI-powered generation of:
    - Solution summaries for each phase.
    - Detailed phase documents based on predefined outlines.
    - Seed data for subsequent phases.
- A modular structure based on Flask, with UI styled using custom CSS.
- Configuration of phases and fields via an external `phases.yaml` file.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** and **pip**
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
- Git (optional, for version control if you host this project)

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Get the Code:**
    Download the ZIP file containing the application and extract it to your desired location.

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate into the `engineering-partner-flask` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    -   **Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):**
        ```cmd
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   **macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    You should see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your prompt.

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install Flask, along with `Flask-SQLAlchemy` and `Flask-Migrate` for database operations, `psycopg2-binary` for PostgreSQL support (though SQLite is the default for development), and `Flask-WTF` for security features like CSRF protection.

5.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    The application requires your Gemini API Key, a Flask Secret Key, and optionally a Database URL.

    *   **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: Your actual API key from Google AI Studio.
    *   **`FLASK_SECRET_KEY`**: A long, random string for securing Flask sessions and other security features. For development, `app.py` has a default, but it's crucial to set your own for production.
    *   **`DATABASE_URL`**: (Optional for development, recommended for production)
        *   Specifies the connection URL for the database.
        *   Example format for PostgreSQL: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
        *   If not set, the application defaults to using a local SQLite database (`instance/app.db`), which is suitable for development and initial testing.

    **Option A: Using `setup_env.ps1` (Windows PowerShell users):**
    If you are on Windows and using PowerShell, you can run the provided script:
    ```powershell
    .\setup_env.ps1
    ```
    This script will prompt you for your Gemini API Key and an optional Flask Secret Key, then set them for your *current PowerShell session only*.

    **Option B: Manual Setup (All Platforms - Recommended for persistence):**

    *   **macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):**
        Open your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`):
        ```bash
        nano ~/.bashrc  # Or your preferred editor and file
        ```
        Add the following lines at the end, replacing placeholders with your actual values:
        ```bash
        export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        export FLASK_SECRET_KEY="your_very_strong_and_unique_secret_key_here"
        ```
        Save the file and reload your shell configuration:
        ```bash
        source ~/.bashrc # Or the file you edited
        ```

    *   **Windows (Command Prompt - for current session):**
        ```cmd
        set GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        set FLASK_SECRET_KEY="your_very_strong_and_unique_secret_key_here"
        set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname"
        ```
        (To set them permanently on Windows, search for "environment variables" in the Start Menu to edit system environment variables.)

6.  **Initialize the Database:**
    After installing dependencies, you need to set up the database schema. These commands should be run from the project root directory where `app.py` is located. You might need to set `FLASK_APP=app.py` in your environment first (e.g., `export FLASK_APP=app.py` on Linux/macOS or `set FLASK_APP=app.py` on Windows CMD for the current session).

    *   **Initialize migrations (if a 'migrations' folder doesn't exist):**
        ```bash
        python -m flask db init
        ```
        This command creates the `migrations` folder and configuration for database schema versioning. Skip if the folder already exists.

    *   **Generate the initial migration script:**
        ```bash
        python -m flask db migrate -m "Initial database setup"
        ```
        This command inspects your SQLAlchemy models (defined in `app.py`) and generates a script to create the corresponding database tables.

    *   **Apply the migration to the database:**
        ```bash
        python -m flask db upgrade
        ```
        This command applies the generated migration script, creating the tables in your database (SQLite by default, or PostgreSQL if `DATABASE_URL` is set).

## Running the Application

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated** (you should see `(.venv)` in your prompt).
2.  **Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set** (see step 5 above).

    **Option A: Using `run_app.ps1` (Windows PowerShell users):**
    If you are on Windows and using PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    .\run_app.ps1
    ```
    This script attempts to activate the venv (if not already) and then starts the Flask app.

    **Option B: Manual Run (All Platforms):**
    Navigate to the `engineering-partner-flask` directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5001`

## Using the Application

-   Navigate through the phases using the sidebar.
-   Enter data into the fields for each phase.
-   Use the buttons to:
    -   **Save Progress**: Saves the current phase's data to the database.
    -   **Generate Solution**: Uses AI to create a summary based on your input for the current phase.
    -   **Generate Document**: Uses AI to create a full Markdown document for the current phase, based on its outline and all data entered up to this point.
    -   **Seed Phase X**: Pre-fills data for the next phase using AI, based on the current phase's content.
-   Generated documents can be downloaded using the link that appears after generation.

## Extending for Other Phases

The application is designed to be dynamic. The HTML templates for phases (`templates/phase_X.html`) are generic and render content based on the `phases.yaml` configuration.

-   **To modify fields or document outlines for any phase:** Edit the corresponding entry in `phases.yaml`.
-   **No HTML changes are usually needed** for `phase_X.html` files if you only change field definitions or document outlines in `phases.yaml`, as the templates adapt dynamically.

## Key Considerations for Further Development

*   **Error Handling**: Enhanced with custom error pages for 404/500 errors, a general exception handler, and more user-friendly feedback on errors.
*   **CSRF Protection**: Implemented using Flask-WTF to protect forms against CSRF attacks.
*   **Database Persistence**: Implemented using Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate. Data is stored in a database (defaults to SQLite if `DATABASE_URL` is not set, PostgreSQL recommended for production). This provides persistent storage across sessions.
*   **User Authentication**: If multiple users or projects are needed, implement a user authentication and authorization system.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: For long-running AI calls, consider using background tasks (e.g., with Celery and Redis/RabbitMQ) to improve UI responsiveness.
*   **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.

Happy Engineering! ðŸš€
